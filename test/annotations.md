# Annotation Tests

Test cases for ChoPro annotations (performance markings).

## Annotations
_Test coverage: performance markings mixed with chords_
```chopro
[C]Basic [*Rit.] and [F]mixed [*Begin softly] annotations
[G]Performance [*Crescendo] marks [Am]with [*Forte] dynamics
[F]Ending [*Diminuendo] with [G]quiet [*pp] and [C]final [*Fine]
```

## Annotations Without Chords
_Test coverage: standalone performance markings in lyrics_
```chopro
This line has [*Andante] tempo marking
Performance with [*Forte] dynamics only
Text with [*Rallentando] slowing down
Final verse [*Diminuendo] ending [*Fine]
```
